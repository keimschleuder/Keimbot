# Keimbot
  My Discord Bot

  This Bot exists to test some new features of the discord API. I am also trying to Add a custom voice channel activity...

  Wish me luck!

# Use the bot yourself

  After creating your Bot, create a File called `Token.py` inside the Folder [Token](/Token/) and Add the Line:
  
      TOKEN = "Your Token here"

  And Replace the String with your Bot Token.

  Now you're all set and you can run [this File](/Main.py).
